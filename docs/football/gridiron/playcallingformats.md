## Play Calling Formats

Below are play calling formats for defense and offense plays in American football. Each format is designed to describe a play in a single line with the fewest words possible. Each format is composed of components describing the formation and other key aspects of the play. The components may also have their own formats. 

Under Defense and Offense, there are several lists of components that make up the format. The lists include all possible options for each component. Each item in the components list starts with a token that will be used within the defensive or offensive format followed by a description of that component. 
## Defense
